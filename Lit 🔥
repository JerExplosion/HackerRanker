Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight

Born sinner, the opposite, of a winner
Remember when I used to eat, sardines for dinner

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

It was all a dream, I used to read Word-Up magazine

The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me

I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
 
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast

Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this

50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur

Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that

Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back

And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source

We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us

Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To all the ladies in the place, with style and grace
Allow me to lace, these lyrical douches in your bushes

But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?

So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)

Forget the telly we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke L's while you do me

In mansion and Benz's givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, f*.k a dollar and a dream

Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellows like dummies
Ya got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place

We in that Sunshine State where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty

And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmie in the city of sex

I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon

Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is

Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve

Caught up in the in crowd, now you're in-style
And in the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I cut me, I'll bleed out, dedication, hard work, sacrifice, meditation
I meditate upon a goal that I'm trying to reach
Grinding all day to the top, and I ain't tryna' sleep
I come and get me (Come and get me)
I'm an animal, cutting through your brain like I'm motherfucking Hannibal
And now I'm grown up, I got a couple dollars on me
Spent a semester in school, I ain't no scholar homie
But who with me? (Who with me?)
Them dudes with me, shoot with me
Pacin' on your ass like Jamaal Tinsley
I'ma lap, uh, twice before he get around
Relaxin' in the seats of this Benz, that's how I get around
I got the money, but that's the root to all evil
I stayed the same, but it's changing all the wrong people
Yeah, uh, and every hater all the same
I'm feelin' like the world is Skip Bayless, and I'm LeBron James
Look, now I got a body full of tattoos
Everybody say that I'm changing, that is not true
Same dude that you met a couple years ago
Talk to the heart, and you can see past the visual
Look, sticking to the game, and I ain't out of bounds
Maryland on my back and I can carry it when I'm out of town
I say, Maryland on my back and yeah, I can carry it when I'm out of town


Uh, it ain't easy, on the path I'm on
Put the world on my back, 'cause I'm that strong
Long journey I been on from the very start
No way I die off with this iron heart
No chance to make it out, that's what they said
Well, look at me, I'm here, boss of the spread
From 602, to 747s
I miss you, Grandma Freda, RIP in heaven
Say what you want 'bout me, but leave the family 'lone
I'll call the goons up and have them freshen up your chromes
I love my niggas, and uh, they up in my heart
'Cause they been down with King James from the very start
Single parent, just moms, and dad gone
It's all good, Pops, you made your kid strong
Ain't no way you can stop this kid, nigga
Momma knew I was a star from the baby bib
I had to make it out, no other option
Now ain't a thing in the world, uh, that I ain't coppin'
Yo ya'll ready know what it is, uh
Now let me just spread my wings
While y'all listen to the voice of this hook sing
Get 'em

There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
